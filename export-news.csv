	Research confirms that direct withdrawal via ACH as a giving method more fully supports nonprofit goals and objectives by retaining and cultivating sustaining donors

	DOWNLOAD RESEARCH

	HERNDON, Va., Oct. 31, 2017 – NACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® today announced the results of two recent studies that explore the role that direct withdrawal via ACH plays in nonprofit donations. The findings conclude that using ACH leads to more frequent and higher dollar contributions from sustaining donors.

	The first study, conducted by ConsumerQuest, evaluated the ways in which people donate, and explored the impact of sustaining donations. The study found that sustaining donors make up the bulk of a nonprofit’s donation income, with 67 percent of organizational donations originating from a person who has given for at least the last three years. The research also demonstrated that direct withdrawal via ACH increases the likelihood of a recurring donation as ACH donors authorize automatically executed donations according to a set schedule (71 percent) versus those using other payment types (9 percent).

	“Direct withdrawal via ACH is the gold standard for recurring payments, such as monthly bills,” says Priscilla Holland, senior director, healthcare and industry verticals, NACHA. “This new research now shows that the same is true in nonprofit giving. Direct withdrawal serves as the foundation on which to build a sustaining donor program.”

	In addition to looking at recurring donations, the study uncovered other advantages of direct withdrawal via ACH, revealing ACH donors give more often, and in higher volume and value, than other donors, specifically:

		ACH donors give more than double ($1,700 versus $650) in a 12-month period than those using paper check, credit/debit card, or other means.

		ACH donors make an average of 8.2 donations compared to 3.5 donations by those who use other payment types in a 12-month period.

	“The findings from the survey align with our own donor experience,” says Jennifer Halm, director of membership, Capital Public Radio in Sacramento, California, a nonprofit organization featured in a NACHA case study. “Seventy-nine percent of our sustaining donors now pay with ACH. They are responsible for more than 43 percent of all individual donation dollars, and we retain new ACH sustainers at an 18 percent higher rate than new sustainers who use credit or debit cards.”

	The study also found that credit/debit card account information often changes for donors, potentially causing an administrative headache for nonprofits. Specifically:

		55 percent of respondents had a credit/debit card reissued in the past year because it had expired or because there was a security concern.

		38 percent of all the credit/debit cards used by respondents were reissued at least once during the past year.

	“Direct withdrawal via ACH payments don’t have the challenges with credit card expiration dates or cancelled cards,” Holland said. “Further, ACH payments are more cost effective for nonprofits than donations made via cards, allowing more of the donation dollars to be directed to the mission of nonprofits instead of processing fees.”

	A second study conducted by ConsumerQuest provided findings to support nonprofits in assessing the donor messages that will resonate in building direct withdrawal via ACH programs. The most convincing single message centered on helping nonprofits maximize resources. The statement, “Donations made via direct withdrawal are more cost-effective for your nonprofit,” rose to the top as a reason for donors to choose ACH payments as their donation method.

	The research is available for download on electronicpayments.org. Additionally, both NACHA and Capital Public Radio expand on these findings, as well as discuss specific program results and best practices for using direct withdrawal via ACH in sustaining donor programs in a presentation, “Building Your Nonprofit’s Sustaining Donor Program with ACH.”  The complimentary webinar recording and PowerPoint presentation are available for download here: https://nacha.adobeconnect.com/ph9jzr42c8hl/. 

	In addition to these resources, NACHA offers a complete nonprofit toolkit, consisting of a case study, checklist, best practices, and more, to support nonprofits in growing sustaining donor programs with direct withdrawal via ACH. These and other tools are available at electronicpayments.org/donor.

97,The Month of May is the Perfect Opportunity to Increase Savings and Build Wealth through Direct Deposit and Split Deposit,"
	NACHA encourages workers to use the electronic deposit of payroll to automate their savings
","
	NACHA encourages workers to use the electronic deposit of payroll to automate their savings

	The problem is clear. Workers are not saving enough for their future nor to cover emergencies that may crop up. In fact, the average personal saving rate – the amount of disposable income put towards saving – hovers around 6 percent, which is far too low.[1] Further, 46 percent of U.S. households do not have $400 readily available to cover an emergency expense.[2]

	
	Yet, the solution is simple. In recognition of Direct Deposit and Direct Payment via ACH Month, which is celebrated annually in May, NACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® continues to promote the value of Direct Deposit and Split Deposit, and how these tools can help increase personal savings and build wealth. 

	“People are not saving. And, worse, they may falsely conclude that they do not earn enough to save regularly,” said Scott M. Lang, AAP, Senior Vice President, Association Services at NACHA. “But there is a way to save automatically that is also simple, safe and flexible.

	“Splitting their Direct Deposit offers workers an effective way to regularly put aside a fixed amount or percentage of their pay automatically and directly into savings and investment accounts for emergencies, planned expenses or retirement,” Lang said. “The importance of automatic savings for workers’ long-term financial future cannot be overstated.”

	According to a recent study conducted by Javelin Strategy and Research, 82 percent of U.S. workers ─ crossing age, income and other demographic categories ─ receive their regular pay using Direct Deposit via ACH. Yet only 24 percent split their deposits, typically placing their pay in a checking account and also designating a portion of funds to go to a savings account, 401(k), a business account, money market or to a prepaid card.
	 
	Of Split Deposit users, 85 percent say it is helping them to save, and 83 percent say the most common use for Split Deposits is for an emergency fund, according to the survey.
	 
	For more information about Direct Deposit, Split Deposit, and saving automatically, visit ElectronicPayments.org. A toolkit of shareable resources to help celebrate Direct Deposit and Direct Payment via ACH Month is also available.
	 
	Additionally, in February, NACHA and partner organizations America Saves and ePayResources launched the “Split to Save” initiative to engage businesses, consumer organizations, financial institutions, government agencies and universities, and help them support the financial health of workers. A “Split to Save” toolkit, which provides educational resources for building awareness about Direct Deposit and Split Deposit, is available for download.

91,NACHA Debuts Nonprofit Toolkit to Support Sustaining Donor Programs,"
	NACHA today debuted its nonprofit toolkit, designed to help nonprofits grow their sustaining donor programs with Direct Payment via ACH. 
","
	Research points to opportunity for ACH payments to increase donor retention

	NACHA debuted its nonprofit toolkit, designed to help nonprofits grow their sustaining donor programs. The toolkit offers practical tips and resources for leveraging direct withdrawal via ACH – a form of Direct Payment via ACH - to retain donors and sustain contributions. 

	The new nonprofit toolkit, available on electronicpayments.org, consists of four core pieces: 
	1.    Case Study – Featuring Capital Public Radio’s “Evergreen” campaign, this case study provides a concrete example of how ACH payments increase donor contributions and retention. The station reports ACH payments are responsible for more than 40 percent of all individual donation dollars, and they retain ACH donors up to 20 percent longer than those using credit cards. 
	2.    Checklist – Identifying specific steps, this checklist simplifies the process of establishing a sustaining donor program with ACH. 
	3.    Best Practices – Once established, nonprofits can enhance and grow their sustaining donor programs by increasing ACH payments. This document outlines tried-and-true practices that deliver increased sustainer donations for nonprofits. 
	4.    Addressing Common Misconceptions – This promotional piece directly addresses and responds to common misconceptions about ACH payments, enabling nonprofits to offer factual responses to donors who may have questions.  

	“ACH payments are the gold standard for recurring payments, and nonprofits rely on recurring donations,” said Priscilla Holland, Senior Director, Healthcare & Industry Verticals, NACHA. “We designed the toolkit to help support the set up and promotion of direct withdrawal via ACH for sustaining donor programs that ultimately will help the nonprofits achieve their program goals.” 

	Research demonstrates that ACH payments can improve donor retention. According to early findings from a study commissioned by NACHA, donors who give via ACH donate more frequently than those who donate via other means. One major reason is because donors who use direct withdrawal via ACH can set up their donations to continue automatically until canceled by the donor. In addition to giving more often, direct withdrawal via ACH donors give more, donating more than double compared to donors who give via paper check, credit card or other means. 

	The research also shows that direct withdrawal via ACH is a payment method donors want to use. Donors cited “familiarity and comfort” and “quick and easy” as the most important factors when choosing their method of payment. Additionally, donors indicated that “the charity receives the donation quickly” and “the method is trustworthy” as additional factors when considering a donation method. 

	“Currently 82 percent of U.S. workers receive their pay via ACH – commonly known as Direct Deposit – and consumers pay more than 800 bills each month via ACH,” said Holland “Additionally, ACH payments are fast and easy. They can be set up online just as quickly as any other type of payment, and most payments can be received by an organization the next day. ACH transactions are safe and have the least incidence of fraud compared to other payment types.  Clearly, ACH payments meet the needs and wants of donors.”

	The new content launched today adds to other resources available to nonprofits. For more information on ACH payments or to download the nonprofit toolkit, visit electronicpayments.org.

	NACHA Launches New Effort to Build Use of ACH Payments to Grow and Retain Donors

	NACHA released a case study on the benefits of using Direct Payment via ACH for donor retention and announced the launch of a new comprehensive outreach effort. The effort is designed to increase awareness and understanding of the value of ACH payments for fundraising, and build confidence in adoption and use of these payments by charitable organizations to grow and sustain donation dollars and their donor base over time.
	 
	“Industry research clearly shows that the contributions of sustaining donors, or those that give on a recurring basis, are worth more than those from traditional donors over the life of their giving,” said Janet O. Estep, NACHA president and CEO. “In addition to donating more frequently and at higher amounts than traditional givers, sustainers continue to give for many years providing for consistent and predictable cash flows and a loyal and committed donor base. Organizations that leverage Direct Payment via ACH for sustained giving can reduce resources spent on fundraising and devote more effort to what matters most: their missions.”
	 
	NACHA’s newest case study highlights the value of Direct Payment via ACH for donation collection. The case study features Capital Public Radio (CapRadio), which is based in Sacramento, Calif., and showcases how it leverages ACH for its sustaining donor program. According to CapRadio, sustaining donors that pay with ACH are responsible for more than 40 percent of all individual donation dollars, and they are retained for up to 20 percent longer than sustainers who use credit or debit cards.
	 
	Recurring Direct Payment via ACH results in less churn among donors because consumers’ bank accounts don’t have expiration dates, and consumer are far less likely to change their main bank accounts than they are with credit cards. Further, recurring ACH payments are just as easy to set up online as any other type of payment. Recurring ACH payments have been the preferred payment method for decades for other types of organizations, such as billing companies for recurring bill payments, and employers of all types and sizes for payroll Direct Deposit.
	 
	“ACH payments can be a powerful tool for charitable organizations of all sizes and types,” said Estep. “It is our hope to enhance awareness and understanding of this payment method as it will go a long way in advancing the invaluable work of our nation’s charitable organizations.”
	 
	To support the launch of the effort and release of the case study, NACHA will be speaking and exhibiting at a variety of events in 2017 including:

		PAYMENTS 2017, Austin, Texas, April 23-26

		AFP International Fundraising Conference (link is external), San Francisco, Calif., April 30 - May 2 

	Additionally, NACHA will be finalizing a number of nonprofit research efforts around donation trends and donor communications, and continuing the development and promotion of resources to support organizations with understanding and adoption of ACH payments. NACHA will continue to release research and new resources as they are developed and finalized to support the nonprofit engagement effort.

	Congressman Gerald E. “Gerry” Connolly of Virginia issued a proclamation into the Congressional Record designating May as Direct Deposit and Direct Payment via ACH Month.

	Celebrated annually in May, Direct Deposit and Direct Payment via ACH Month seeks to raise awareness that the electronic deposit of payroll yields important benefits to employees, their employers, and financial institutions.

	Congressman Connolly stated, “Today, more than 80 percent of U.S. workers receive their regular pay using Direct Deposit via ACH, and consumers pay 800 million bills each month with Direct Payment via ACH.

	“Direct Deposit and Direct Payment are an easy, safe, convenient, cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to make and receive payments. Use of Direct Deposit and Direct Payment enable consumers and businesses alike to save costs, save time and protect the environment by eliminating the time, hassle and expense of writing and cashing paper checks and making trips to the bank or credit union,” Connelly said.

	According to the results of a new survey conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research on behalf of NACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® and America Saves, a campaign managed by the Consumer Federation of America, usage of Direct Deposit via ACH has increased to 82 percent of U.S. workers, up from 74 percent in 2011.

	The survey’s resulting white paper, “Beyond Simple and Safe: Opportunities to Expand the Use of Direct Deposit via ACH for Payroll,” also details that satisfaction among users of Direct Deposit via ACH and awareness among nonusers are also high at 87 percent and 79 percent, respectively.

	Additionally, nearly one in four employees (24 percent) split their payroll deposits, typically placing their deposit in a checking account and also designating a portion of funds to go to a savings account, 401(k), business account, money market or to a prepaid card.

	NACHA also details the survey findings in a new infographic that captures the sentiments of consumers who use Direct Deposit via ACH and identifies the holdouts.

36,New NACHA Survey Shows Adoption and Awareness of Direct Deposit via ACH Continues to Build,"
	New NACHA survey shows a full 82 percent of U.S. workers ─ crossing age, income and other demographic categories ─ are paid by Direct Deposit via ACH, up from 74 percent in 2011.
","
	PHOENIX, April 19, 2016 – A full 82 percent of U.S. workers ─ crossing age, income and other demographic categories ─ are paid by Direct Deposit via ACH, up from 74 percent in 2011. Awareness is also strong, with 79 percent of consumers who do not use Direct Deposit via ACH reporting familiarity with the service, according to the results of a new survey conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research on behalf of NACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® and America Saves, a campaign managed by the Consumer Federation of America.

	Employees are highly satisfied with Direct Deposit via ACH (87 percent), which provides for the electronic deposit of payroll. They also believe it to be safe and secure (83 percent versus 52 percent of employees paid by check), that it helps them better control their finances (72 percent versus 54 percent), and that it helps them pay their bills on time (73 percent versus 46 percent).

	The survey’s resulting white paper, “Beyond Simple and Safe: Opportunities to Expand the Use of Direct Deposit via ACH for Payroll,” also details the top reasons employees use Direct Deposit via ACH, including faster access to pay (53 percent), which is also cited as an advantage by younger Generation Y (60 percent) and part-time employees (51 percent); no cost (47 percent); and it eliminates the risk of losing a paper check (38 percent).

	“Direct Deposit via ACH is widely used and well-entrenched in the nation’s consciousness. Consumers trust the electronic deposit of their payroll because it is a fast, safe and secure method to receive their pay and it helps them to better control their finances with timely and predictable availability of funds,” said Janet O. Estep, president and CEO of NACHA. “With the advent of new capabilities like Same Day ACH to better support hourly and part-time workers, financial institutions, employers and payroll providers will have new opportunities to encourage adoption and use of Direct Deposit via ACH.”

	Yet even with the steady increase in Direct Deposit via ACH usage through the years, there is still room for more growth. The 18 percent of employed U.S. consumers who are not paid by Direct Deposit via ACH can be readily identified within three key population segments: younger Generation Y (Gen Y.1 who are ages 18 to 24), lower-income workers (with household income under $50,000 per year), and part-time workers.

	“It’s good for the consumer and it’s good for society if we can introduce young Americans to Direct Deposit via ACH starting with their first paycheck,” said Mark Schwanhausser, director, omnichannel financial services, for Javelin. “The biggest obstacles are the availability of Direct Deposit and misconceptions about the benefits. Employers and financial institutions are critical to bridging this gap – and they will see significant benefits as a result.”

	Of consumers who use or are aware of Direct Deposit via ACH, 21 percent indicate that they first learned of the option from their bank or credit union. Further, Direct Deposit via ACH users expressed higher satisfaction with their financial institutions where their pay is deposited than nonusers, awarding an average of nine out of 10 points. Meanwhile, 64 percent of Direct Deposit via ACH users utilize the service because their employer encourages or requires it. Conversely, 37 percent of employees who do not use Direct Deposit report that their employers do not offer the option. Additionally, consumers paid by check, cash or other means have somewhat less satisfaction with their employers’ payroll options, giving them an average rating of six out of 10 points.

	“Financial institutions and employers play a vital role in encouraging usage and facilitating enrollment in Direct Deposit via ACH,” said George Barany, director of financial education for America Saves, a national campaign managed by the Consumer Federation of America. “We strongly encourage employers across industry sectors to engage with their employees, and for banks and credit unions to work with their consumer customers and their large and small business customers to better inform them about the value of Direct Deposit via ACH.”

NACHA also details the survey findings in a new infographic that captures the sentiments of consumers who use Direct Deposit via ACH and identifies the holdouts.

	About the 2015 Direct Deposit Survey 
	The 2015 Direct Deposit Survey was conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research on behalf of NACHA—The Electronic Payments Association® and America Saves, a campaign managed by the Consumer Federation of America. The online survey, conducted in August 2015, queried more than 2,000 consumers and specifically targeted the Generation Y (18-34 years old) population and the segment of consumers aged 35 years and older. Survey participants were required to be employed on either a full- or part-time basis, providing them an opportunity to receive Direct Deposit via ACH.

According to the results of a soon-to-be-released survey conducted on behalf of NACHA and the Consumer Federation of America by Javelin Strategy and Research, 82 percent of U.S. workers ─ crossing age, income and other demographic categories ─ receive their regular pay using Direct Deposit via ACH. Nearly one in four employees (24 percent) split their payroll deposits, typically placing their deposit in a checking account and also designating a portion of funds to go to a savings account, 401(k), business account, money market or to a prepaid card. “Direct Deposit via ACH, which facilitates the use of split deposit, is simple, safe and flexible,” said Scott M. Lang, AAP, senior vice president, Association Services at NACHA. “To help individuals more fully realize these benefits, we encourage employers and financial institutions to promote split deposit as a way to regularly put aside a fixed amount or percentage of their pay automatically and directly into savings and investment accounts for emergencies, planned expenses or retirement.” “America Saves Week promotes the importance and effectiveness of saving automatically, and split deposit is one of the best ways to improve one’s money management and save for one’s long-term financial future,” said George Barany, director of Financial Education for America Saves, a national campaign managed by the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.
